<h1>About.... Me!</h1>

<div class="container">
    
        Now it is finally my time to tell about myself! <br>
        Im a huge beer fanatic, not to confuse with an alcoholic. Im a 4th semester student, and I love coding!<br><br>
        I created this website as a mandatory assignment, where I learned a lot. Both from internet research, from help from classmates, but also from helping other classmates aswell.<br><br>
        Now im finally done with this project, and you are welcome to give feedback on the staticbeer@gmail.com, or on Fronter if you are a teacher. <br>
        Have a great day, and if you ever get the chance to get the Big Doink - get it!<br>
